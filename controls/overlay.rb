    desc 'Enterprise environments make account management for applications and databases challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

    A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. 

    Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. 
    Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

    Account management and authentication in a Windows environment normally use an LDAP-compatible directory service, usually Windows Active Directory.  This in turn, in the CMS environment, is typically integrated with the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  Additional technologies or products may be employed that when placed together constitute an overall mechanism supporting an organization\'s automated account management requirements.  An example is the use of Group Policy Objects to enforce rules concerning passwords.

    SQL Server must be configured to use Windows authentication, with SQL Server authentication disabled.  If circumstances (such as the architecture of a purchased application) make it necessary to have SQL Server authentication available, its use must be kept to a minimum.  The reasons for its use, and the measures taken to restrict it to only the necessary cases, must be documented, with AO approval.

    It is assumed throughout this STIG that this integration has been implemented.'

    desc 'Authentication with a CMS-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access the SQL Server instance and server-level resources. To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by CMS-approved PKIs, all CMS systems, including SQL Server instances, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. 

    Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. 

    Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. 

    This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes SQL Server.  If SQL Server is not configured to follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.'
